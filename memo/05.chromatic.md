## chromatic を適用する。

github に push をした際に hook を経由して chromatic に反映させるようにする。

# Event for the workflow
on: push

# List of jobs
jobs:
  chromatic-deployment:
    # Operating System

    # Job steps
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
        # 👇 Adds Chromatic as a step in the workflow
      - name: Publish to Chromatic
        uses: chromaui/action@v1
        # Chromatic GitHub Action options
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # 👇 Chromatic projectToken, refer to the manage page to obtain it.
          projectToken: ${{ secrets.CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
```

### chromatic に project を追加する。

build-storybook がないとエラーがでる。

```console
✖ Build script not found
The CLI didn't find a script called "build-storybook" in your package.json.
Make sure you set the --build-script-name option to the value of the script name that builds your Storybook.
```

下記追記

```json
"scripts": {
  "build-storybook": "build-storybook"
}
```

```console
yarn add --dev chromatic
npx chromatic --project-token=xxxxxxxxx
```

xxxxx は、自動生成される。
package.json に json を追加する。

```console
❯ npx chromatic --project-token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ℹ Speed up Continuous Integration
Your project is linked to GitHub so Chromatic will report results there.
This means you can pass the --exit-once-uploaded flag to skip waiting for build results.

⚠ No 'chromatic' script found in your package.json
Would you like me to add it for you? [y/N] N

ℹ No problem. You can add it to your package.json yourself like so:
"scripts": {
  "chromatic": "npx chromatic --project-token xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

`.env`に`CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN`を追加する。
